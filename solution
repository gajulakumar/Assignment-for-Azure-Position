Proposed Solution: Tiered Storage with Transparent Data Access

Overview: You separate billing records into two tiers based on age:

Hot Data: Records from the past three months continue to reside in Azure Cosmos DB for low-latency, high-frequency reads.

Cold Data: Records older than three months are periodically migrated to Azure Blob Storage, which offers significantly lower storage costs.

Implementation Steps
Automated Data Migration:

Periodic Scanning: Use an Azure Function with a timer trigger to run at regular intervals.

Identification: The function queries Cosmos DB for billing records older than three months using a timestamp filter.

Migration: Each identified record (up to 300 KB in size) is exported—serialized to JSON—and stored in a designated container in Azure Blob Storage.

Verification & Cleanup: Once the record is successfully copied (with checksum verification or other integrity checks), the record is deleted from Cosmos DB to free up expensive storage.

Data Access Layer Adjustment:

Unified Read Logic: Introduce a lightweight logic layer behind your API. Upon receiving a record request, this layer first queries Cosmos DB.

Fallback to Archive: If the record isn’t found (implying it has been migrated), it then queries Azure Blob Storage and returns the result.

Seamless Integration: Since this change is confined to the backend’s data retrieval mechanism, the API endpoints exposed to clients remain exactly the same, ensuring no impact on consumers.

Monitoring & Error Handling:

Azure Monitor/Application Insights: Track the migration process and record query performance.

Robust Error Handling: Incorporate retry mechanisms and logging in the Azure Function to safeguard against transient failures, ensuring no data loss

        H --> I[Verify and delete records from Cosmos DB]
    end

Diagram Explanation:

Client & API Layer: Clients continue to send requests to your unchanged API endpoint.

Data Access Layer: The API now routes its read operations through a lookup mechanism that checks Cosmos DB first (for recent records). If the record isn’t found, it queries the Blob Storage where older records are archived.

Data Migration Process: An Azure Function, activated on a schedule, scans for records in Cosmos DB older than three months, migrates them to Blob Storage, and safely removes them from Cosmos DB after verification.
